# IntersectNet: Traffic Flow? Managed

IntersectNET simulates traffic flow using the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and optimizes traffic at intersections using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The simulation models urban traffic as a network of roads (edges) and intersections (nodes), aiming to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow through optimization.

## Project Overview

The project includes:

- **Traffic Simulation**: 
  - Uses the **Cell Transmission Model (CTM)** to simulate traffic flow on a road network.
  - Models vehicle behavior along roads with varying densities and speeds.
  
- **Optimization with Genetic Algorithm**:
  - Optimizes traffic signal timings at intersections to minimize congestion.
  - Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to adjust traffic flow based on vehicle demand and supply dynamics.
  
- **Before and After Comparison**:
  - Compares traffic conditions before and after optimization using visualizations and travel time metrics.
  
## Key Features

- **Simulation of Traffic Flow**: Simulates vehicle movement on a network of roads and intersections over time.
- **Optimization of Traffic Signals**: Optimizes traffic signal control at intersections to reduce overall travel time.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides various plots showing traffic density, travel times, and intersection flow.
- **Before and After Analysis**: Displays the improvement in traffic flow and reduction in congestion after optimization.
