# IntersectNET
IntersectNET simulates traffic flow using the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and optimizes traffic at intersections using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The simulation models urban traffic as a network of roads (edges) and intersections (nodes), aiming to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow through optimization.
