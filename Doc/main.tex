\section{Introduction}
Urbanization has led to increased vehicular traffic, resulting in significant congestion in metropolitan areas. Efficient traffic management is crucial to alleviate congestion, reduce travel times, and minimize environmental impacts. Traditional traffic control systems rely on fixed signal timings and simplistic intersection models, which often fail to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions.

\textbf{IntersectNet} aims to address these challenges by providing an advanced mathematical framework for modeling traffic flow at intersections. By incorporating heterogeneous vehicle types, dynamic signal control, and hybrid optimization techniques, IntersectNet seeks to optimize traffic movement across urban networks. This paper outlines the theoretical underpinnings, mathematical modeling, optimization strategies, and simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of IntersectNet.

\section{Mathematical Modeling}
The mathematical modeling in IntersectNet encompasses two primary components: the modeling of streets (road segments) and the modeling of intersections. These models capture the dynamics of traffic flow, vehicle interactions, and the influence of traffic signals on vehicle movement.

\subsection{Modeling Streets}
Streets are represented as \textbf{edges} in a directed graph, where each edge corresponds to a road segment connecting two intersections (vertices). The traffic flow on each street is modeled using the \textit{Cell Transmission Model (CTM)}, a discrete-time and discrete-space model that captures the fundamental relationships between traffic density, flow, and speed.

\subsubsection{Traffic Flow Models}
The fundamental relationship governing traffic flow is given by:
\[
q = \rho \cdot v
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q$ is the traffic flow (vehicles per second),
    \item $\rho$ is the traffic density (vehicles per meter),
    \item $v$ is the average vehicle speed (meters per second).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cell Transmission Model (CTM)} divides each street into a series of cells, each representing a segment of road with length $\Delta x$. Time is discretized into intervals of $\Delta t$. The CTM updates traffic density and flow in each cell based on sending and receiving functions, $S(i)$ and $R(i)$, respectively:

\[
S(i) = \min\left(v_{\text{free-flow}} \cdot \rho(i) \cdot \Delta t, Q_{\text{max}}\right)
\]

\[
R(i) = \min\left(w \cdot \left(\rho_{\text{max}} - \rho(i)\right) \cdot \Delta t, Q_{\text{max}}\right)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $v_{\text{free-flow}}$ is the free-flow speed,
    \item $w$ is the congestion wave speed,
    \item $\rho_{\text{max}}$ is the jam density,
    \item $Q_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum flow capacity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Heterogeneous Traffic (Multiple Vehicle Types)}
Urban traffic comprises various vehicle types, each with distinct characteristics affecting traffic dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cars}: Smaller, faster vehicles.
    \item \textbf{Buses}: Larger, slower vehicles with longer reaction times.
    \item \textbf{Trucks}: Heavy vehicles with significant impact on traffic flow and lane availability.
\end{itemize}

Each vehicle type is characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Length} $L$: Physical length of the vehicle.
    \item \textbf{Maximum Speed} $v_{\text{max}}$: Top speed under free-flow conditions.
\end{itemize}

Incorporating multiple vehicle types into the model allows for more accurate simulation of real-world traffic conditions, influencing both density and flow calculations.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Speed Limits}
Dynamic speed limits adjust based on current traffic conditions to optimize flow and reduce congestion. The adjusted speed $v_{\text{adjusted}}$ is a function of traffic density:
\[
v_{\text{adjusted}} = v_{\text{free-flow}} \times \left(1 - \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{critical}}}\right)
\]
Where $\rho_{\text{critical}}$ is the critical density beyond which congestion begins to significantly impact flow.

\subsection{Modeling Intersections}
Intersections are modeled as nodes where multiple streets converge, necessitating control mechanisms to manage the flow of vehicles from incoming to outgoing streets.

\subsubsection{Traffic Signal Control}
Traffic signals at intersections regulate vehicle movement through signal phases (green, yellow, red). The timing of these signals is critical for managing flow and minimizing congestion. The model employs dynamic signal control, where signal phases are adjusted based on real-time traffic conditions, such as queue lengths and incoming flow rates.

Let:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_g$ be the green light duration,
    \item $T_r$ be the red light duration,
    \item $T_c = T_g + T_r$ be the total signal cycle time.
\end{itemize}

Dynamic adjustment of $T_g$ and $T_r$ allows the system to respond to fluctuating traffic demands, optimizing flow and reducing waiting times.

\subsubsection{Queue Dynamics at Intersections}
Queues form at intersections when incoming flow exceeds the capacity of outgoing streets. The queue length $Q(t)$ at an intersection evolves as:
\[
Q(t+1) = Q(t) + \Delta t \cdot \left(q_{\text{in}}(t) - q_{\text{out}}(t)\right)
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q_{\text{in}}(t)$ is the incoming flow,
    \item $q_{\text{out}}(t)$ is the outgoing flow.
\end{itemize}

Properly managing queue lengths is essential to prevent gridlock and ensure smooth traffic progression.

\subsubsection{Multi-Modal Traffic Management}
Incorporating different vehicle types requires multi-modal traffic management at intersections. Strategies include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dedicated Lanes}: Allocating specific lanes for buses or trucks to streamline their movement.
    \item \textbf{Priority Rules}: Giving precedence to certain vehicle types (e.g., emergency vehicles) to enhance safety and efficiency.
\end{itemize}

These strategies help in balancing the diverse traffic demands and maintaining optimal flow across all vehicle types.

\section{Optimization of Traffic Flow}
Optimizing traffic flow involves adjusting signal timings and transition matrices to achieve desired performance metrics, such as minimizing total travel time and maximizing flow stability. IntersectNet employs a \textbf{hybrid optimization approach} combining \textit{Genetic Algorithms (GA)} and \textit{Simulated Annealing (SA)} to navigate the complex solution space effectively.

\subsection{Hybrid Optimization Techniques}
\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithms (GA)}
Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. They operate on a population of potential solutions, applying operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations. In IntersectNet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population}: Each individual represents a set of transition matrices for all intersections.
    \item \textbf{Fitness Function}: Evaluates individuals based on the total travel time and flow stability.
    \item \textbf{Selection}: Favors individuals with higher fitness scores for reproduction.
    \item \textbf{Crossover and Mutation}: Generate new individuals by combining and altering parent solutions, introducing variability.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulated Annealing (SA)}
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It explores the solution space by allowing occasional acceptance of worse solutions to escape local optima. In IntersectNet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temperature Parameter}: Controls the probability of accepting worse solutions, gradually decreasing over time.
    \item \textbf{Acceptance Criterion}: Determines whether to accept a new solution based on the temperature and the difference in fitness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Objective Optimization}
Traffic flow optimization is inherently multi-objective, balancing conflicting goals such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimizing Total Travel Time}: Reduces the cumulative time vehicles spend traversing the network.
    \item \textbf{Maximizing Flow Stability}: Ensures consistent flow, preventing abrupt changes that lead to congestion.
\end{itemize}

IntersectNet's optimization framework integrates these objectives into a composite fitness function, enabling the algorithm to find balanced solutions that enhance overall traffic efficiency.

\section{Implementation}

The implementation of IntersectNet is structured in Python, leveraging object-oriented programming to encapsulate streets and intersections. The simulation employs the Cell Transmission Model for traffic dynamics and applies a hybrid optimization approach for signal control.
